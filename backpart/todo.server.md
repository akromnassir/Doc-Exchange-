-   migrate from bcrypt to argon2 [done]
-   dont just rely on jwt token for auth but also check for user in DB [done]
-   token revokation on logout [done]
-   add isverified to all routes
-   specify role in email body
-   turn on validations
-   isActive isVerified validation middlewares
-   make all the attributes/values lowercase when saving to DB
-   make sure to not send password/private key in response
-   add timestamps to all the models
-   promoting assistant to senior assistant
-   delete notifications from database or not

-   Admin can create new senior assistant, only if any approver dont have senior assistant, or if
    previous sr. assitant is disabled
-   solution for frequent database calls, use redis for storing user active not active,
    only call the db when the entry is not found in redis
-   on login, store the user active (possibly whole userdata) in redis along with the jwt token

ðŸ’¡ Optimized Approach
Instead of checking the database every time, consider caching isActive in Redis.

ðŸš€ Steps for Optimization
When user logs in â†’ Cache isActive in Redis.
On each request â†’ Check Redis instead of DB.
When admin updates isActive â†’ Update Redis.
If Redis entry expires â†’ Fetch from DB again.


- if admin deactivates account of an approver, he can add new approver
- after creation of new approver the old one cannot be re-activated, only one approver can be enabled at a time 


- update profile, terminate session (admin)
- get profile data for everyone
- change user status (admin)
- comment out send otp reset password
- while updating user, only following fields can be updated
    - fullName
    - mobileNo
    - email
    - password

## concerns
1. sending credentials to user secure?
